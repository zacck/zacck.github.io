# This is the way

I started today's class by reading the questions and answers on the lesson that I was embarking on something about Ohm's law and circuit analysis...

Well thats not the key bit today, here's my take aways from the lesson

- LEDs (Light emitting diodes) conventionally have a flat side that also is the side with the short leg and you would never guess this side is also the one with the larger internal structure/plate. If you are like me and can never find the cathode without a quick search remember the one of the last few points and you have your cathode.


- The bigger lesson today is to never waste time thinking about a circuit or even trying to explain a circuit. What Electrical Engineers do is draw a circuit and then sharing, analysing and even debugging can be done of the schematic one has drawn.

To the above effect I drew and implemented a very simple LED circuit see below

I drew a circuit with a couple of switches and LEDs

I then built the circuit

This is the way! See you soon

Happy Today!
