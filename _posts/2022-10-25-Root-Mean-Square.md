# Root Mean Square

A bit of a background, I have a very volatile attention span, sometimes I can focus and get engrossed for hours. However most times I can barely focus on one thing and in these times I am usually consuming a few channels of information. A chat, a video and a conversation could all happen at the same time.

So why am I writing about my attention span, you see I always loved math but because I live in my head so much I have never been any good at it, so today when I ran into the **Root Mean Square** function with me being a little older and a tad excited I paid attention and I love the formula!! 


## What is a Root Mean Square

A root mean square or RMS is a single value that is used to represent a sort of average from a periodic wave form, consider alternating current let's assume alternating current is delivered in a sinusidal wave form. In Kenya where I am from the power company delivers 240 Volts at a 50Hertz frequency. What does this mean the alternating power that comes out of our socket is moving from its negative peak to its positive peak 50 times a second hence 50 Hertz or 50Hz. 

It would be easy to assume then that the average value of power delivered would 240V, and we would be wrong in assuming that. How come? this is because alternating current moves from positive peaks to negative peaks and if this peaks were the same as they usually are our average would be 0. Now that's not a useful number, hence RMS! 

Wikipedia defines [RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square) the root mean square of a set of numbers is defined as the square root of the mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares) of the set. In voltage we compute this by squaring the value of the voltage ( this gets rid of the negative issue) then taking the average of the resulting values and then getting a square root of that. 

Lets use this to find out the peaks of voltage supply in kenya
